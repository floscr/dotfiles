* Systems Configurations

** Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon Gen 9

Configurations at [[https://github.com/floscr/dotfiles/blob/main/hosts/thinknixx1/default.nix][thinknixx1/default.nix]]

Decent dev machine, good hardware support.

** Lenovo Thinkpad T490s (Retired)

Old work machine, removed the configs, but for anyone with a maching device can look up the configs at https://github.com/floscr/dotfiles/commit/a68c69beb59f496e7962a104fdccaa7e469db2e0

I would not recommend this machine as the thermals are absolutely horrible and you have to work with constant CPU throttling.
